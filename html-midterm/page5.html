    <h2>Page 1</h2>

    <ul>
        <li>On Line 1 the code was missing "doctype html".</li>
        <li>On line 74 I fixed the p tag to make it a closing tag.</li>
        <li>On line 80 I got rid of the e tag and made it a closing em tag.</li>
        <li>Was missing content in the head (line 11-14)</li>
        <li>swapped h2 and h3 tags on line 36 and 37 </li>
        </ul>


        <h2>Page 2</h2>

        <ul>
            <li>On line 27 I did the proper closing b tag because before it just said"<>"</li>
            <li>On line 53 there was h2 tags within the b tags, so I removed the b tags</li>
            <li>Changed line 74, instead of h6 tags I did h2 tags</li>
            <li>Fixed a spacing issue on line 41 with the link to the website</li>
            </ul>



            <h2>Page 3</h2>

            <ul>

                <li>Line 82 under the name lily was missing a clossing tag</li>
                <li>line 82 moved to line 85 to keep proper syntax of the chart</li>
                <li>Moved the original line 94 to line 91 to keep proper syntax on the chart</li>
