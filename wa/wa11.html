          <p>I started off by changing the api to a sports trivia website. Then I wanted to make the title stand out, so isntead of it just being one color, I made an animation that flashes the rainbow in seconds. The newest feature I added is a link to instagram in the "post it" button. If you are very passionate about the sports fact that you got you could share it to your story or post it. Lastly I played around with different colors for the website. When you hover over both buttons there is a hover effect.</p>
