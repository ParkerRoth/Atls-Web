    <h2>My Interests</h2>
    <p>My main interests include basketball and art.</p>
    <p> Growing up I played basketball and I would practice everyday. I don't play very often anymore, however I watch a lot of college basketball and NBA. Now it feels like everyday I am watching basketball. I enjoy watching college basketball more than the NBA because there is a lot more passion at the college level.</p>
    <p>Another big passion of mine is art. I've been drawing ever since I was a little kid and I haven't stopped since. I started off just copying other cartoons, then I started making my own cartoon characters, next I tried to pursue realism, then I got bored and decided to draw abstract art, and then recently I started pursuing digital art. Through my digital art I am able to recreate photos in my own unique art style. In my art my charcters where a mask and only have one eye. This concept is inspired by an abstract piece I created where I created something that looked like a face. I took that idea and ran with it. </p>
